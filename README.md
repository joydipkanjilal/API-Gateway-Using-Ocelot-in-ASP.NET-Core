## **Prerequisites**

To execute the code examples shown in this article, here are the minimum requirements you should have installed in your system:

-   .NET 5 SDK

## Running the Application

This repository is the code accompanying the article on API gateway.  This repository contains 3 projects - an API Gateway project, a Customer microservice project and a Product microservice project.

The two other projects OrderProcessing.Product and OrderProcessing.Customer should be automatically added to the same solution when the solution file is opened in Visual Studio. Accordingly,  there would be three folders namely, OrderProcessing,  OrderProcessing.Customer and OrderProcessing.Product.

To run the application, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Locate the .sln file inside the OrderProcessing folder
2. Double click to open it in any editor (preferably Visual Studio 2019)
3. Compile the application
4. Press F5 to run the application
